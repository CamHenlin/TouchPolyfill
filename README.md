Touch Polyfill
===
This is a JavaScript polyfill that adds [TouchEvent](http://www.w3.org/TR/touch-events/) functionality to browsers with [PointerEvent](http://www.w3.org/TR/pointerevents/) functionality, such as Internet Explorer 10 and 11.

Why?
===
Because you should be able to use whichever types of events you want in your code, and also to ease transition of old products on to new platforms without rewriting code.

Usage
===
Include touchpolyfill.js or touchpolyfill.min.js on your page and keep using touch events.

Demo
===
You can view a functional demo of the touch polyfill at: [demo](http://henlin.net/TouchPolyfill/demo.html)
